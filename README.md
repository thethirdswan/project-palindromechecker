# Palindrome Checker
A simple website to check whether a word is a palindrome or not. Just a random project out of boredom. Comes with the definition of palindrome in the website!
This is also a part of my [certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/thethirdswan/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8) project.
